Hey everyone,

Welcome to my repository resuming all the projects I have done in my academic course about QA - Automation Engineering. First of all, I'm happy to know you still reading this quick introduction, so if you are a student looking for resources to learn more about QA and Automation I hope it will help you as much as possible, and if you are a recruiter, I hope it will represent as much as possible my skills in this type of engineering (I'm proud to say that I get an 100/100 grade it this course!).
